## 🔍 Background

The Viwoods Reader blocks notifications using a **hardcoded application whitelist** inside the system services code.
The check lives in `services.jar` (specifically `classes2.dex`) and drops notifications from non-whitelisted apps before they are posted, even when notification permissions are enabled.

### Technical Context

* **File:** `/system/framework/services.jar`
* **DEX:** `classes2.dex`
* **Class:** `com.android.server.notification.NotificationManagerService`

Firmware **1.3.8** introduced two additional filter points compared to earlier versions:

| Method | Filter |
|--------|--------|
| `enqueueNotificationInternal()` | `ALLOWED_PKGS` hardcoded package whitelist |
| `checkDisqualifyingFeatures()` | XOR-inverted `areNotificationsEnabledForPackageInt()` result |
| `PostNotificationRunnable.postNotification()` | `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission check against the whitelist |

All three are patched in the 1.3.8 release.

## ✅ What This Module Does

This Magisk module **patches `classes2.dex` inside `services.jar` systemlessly** to disable the notification whitelist check.

### Patch Summary

* Disables the notification whitelist check
* Allows all applications to post notifications
* Applied systemlessly via Magisk
* Fully reversible by removing the module

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements

* **Unlocked bootloader**
* **Root access via Magisk**

  * Root **requires patching `init_boot.img`** using the Magisk app
* Viwoods firmware **1.1.0**, **1.2.3**, or **1.3.8**

### Steps

## ⚡ Recommended [![Download inkOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-inkOS-brightgreen?style=flat\&logo=android)](https://github.com/gezimos/inkOS/releases/latest)

Since the Viwoods Reader **lacks a native pull-down notification tray**, it is **recommended to use [inkOS](https://github.com/gezimos/inkOS)** — a minimalist, **eink‑friendly Android launcher with notification tray support**.
*Provides a gesture assignable notification tray while native pop-ups continue to work without it.*
